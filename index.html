                                        I am a physicist and programmer based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, where I graduated with a first-class Masters Degree in Physics with Astrophysics from Northumbria University.
                                        I have a passion for understanding the mysteries of the universe through both theoretical exploration and practical experimentation, having dedicated my academic journey to delving into the realm of astrophysics.
                                        I have been using computers and coding for essentially my entire life and such my proficiency in languages such as Python, C#, C++, and Java has enabled me to not only analyze complex data sets but also to develop simulations that model astronomical phenomena with precision.
                                        I am also experienced with Git having used it for version control since College and am well versed in LaTeX having employed it for both my Bachelor's and Master's dissertations.
                                        In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid chess player, finding joy in the strategic depths and mental challenges it offers, likewise, I enjoy playing video games such as Factorio, where problem-solving and optimization skills are essential.
                                        As I transition from academia into industry, I am eager to apply my interdisciplinary skills to tackle real-world challenges, whether it be in the domain of scientific research, software development, or beyond.

                                        My master's dissertation was concerned with the study of hemispheric asymmetries within the field-aligned currents in the Earth's magnetosphere.
                                        This investigation entailed the processing of extensive data sets and was the first investigation of this kind to employ the use of ground-based observation.
                                        For this I employed several advanced techniques in Python for data manipulation and analysis to compare 2 years worth of magnetometer data.
                                        The data from this investigation confirmed several previous observations as well as observing for the first time the impact of the atmosphere on magnetospheric currents.

                                        For my bachelor's dissertation I investigated white dwarf accretion disks to determine the impact that speed and angle of rotation have on accretion timescales.
                                        This involved producing a model in C# of the forces of gravity, Poynting-Robertson drag, and diamagnetic drag to simulate the orbits of particles in various configurations.
                                        I then used python to analyse and graph the data, finding novel scenarios which helped elucidate previously unexplainable observations of white dwarfs.

                                        I am working on producing an accurate Newtonian N-Body simulator taking advantage of C++ and using Raylib for real-time graphics.
                                        The simulator is fully 3D, using the RKF45 iterative method for each time-step and can use Eulerian integration to predict the future paths of each body.
                                        Users can interact with every facet of the simulation in real-time, with free camera movement and the ability to adjust the tolerance of each time-step.

                                        Using C#, I developed an AI for the game of chess.
                                        Leveraging the MiniMax algorithm, the AI autonomously navigates through the tree of possible moves,
                                        analyzing each potential position to calculate the best possible move at any given search depth.

                                        My Bachelor's Dissertation on white dwarf accretion dynamics is a notable example of of my ability to perform research and produce complex astrophysical simulations, achieving a mark of 83% for the final report.
                                        Additionally my Masters Dissertation was the first to use ground-based data to reproduce data on the current asymmetries in the Earth's hemispheres, requiring substantial data analysis and advanced computational techniques.
                                        Aside from astrophysics, this degree has also equipped me with a strong foundational understanding of classical mechanics, thermal and nuclear physics, electromagnetism, and quantum physics.
